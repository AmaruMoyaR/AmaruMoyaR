## About Me
Pronouns: he/him 

BSc in Physics, Universidad de Chile (2019 -- 2023)

MSc in Physics Student at Universidad de ConcepciÃ³n (2024 -- )

I am always in search of a good, high quality result in everything that I care about.

## Research Interests
- Quantum Optics
- Nonlinear Phenomena
- Classical Optics
- Light Matter Interactions

## Iâ€™m currently working on:

### Manipulating Optical properties of Atomic Alkali Vapors 
  - Experimental and theoretical approach to studying how light might affect the index of refraction of the medium, and characterizing the nonlinear effects.
  - Using Python, Mathematica and Julia
    
## Past projects

### Coupled Duffing Oscillators
  - My first project (2022).
  - I solved the Duffing equation for coupled oscillators using RK4.
  - Studied phase diagrams and did parameter sweeps to create bifurcation diagrams and study the dynamics created.

### Three Level Atom interacting with quantized cavity fields
  - Two and three level atom interacting with quantized cavity fields. Studying it through the Wigner function. (2023)
  - Using QuTip, SciPy

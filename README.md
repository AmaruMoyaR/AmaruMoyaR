## About Me
Pronouns: he/him 

BSc in Physics, Universidad de Chile (2019 - 2023)

Msc in Physics Student at Universidad de ConcepciÃ³n (2024 - )

I am always in search of a good, high quality result in everything that I care about.

## Research Interests
- Quantum Mechanics
- Nonlinear Phenomena
- Optics
- Light Matter Interactions

## Iâ€™m currently working on:

### Three Level Atom interacting with quantized cavity fields
  - Two and three level atom interacting with quantized cavity fields. With a strong approach to the use of the Wigner function.
  - Using QuTip, SciPy
    
## Past projects

### Coupled Duffing Oscillators (Private)
  - My first project (2022).
  - I solved the Duffing equation for coupled oscillators using RK4.
  - Studied phase diagrams and did parameter sweeps to create bifurcation diagrams and study the dynamics created.
